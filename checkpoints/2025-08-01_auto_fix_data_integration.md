# Checkpoint: Auto-Save & Data Integration Fixes

**Date**: 2025-08-01 03:37:00  
**Type**: Major System Integration  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  

## 🎯 Session Summary

Major breakthrough in resolving auto-save and statistics display issues. Successfully integrated multi-storage system for seamless data access across guest and authenticated modes.

## 📋 Key Accomplishments

### ✅ Database Schema Issues Resolved
- **Fixed Missing Columns**: Identified and resolved `additional_images` column missing from remote Supabase
- **Schema Compatibility**: Updated storage layer to work with current database structure
- **Achievement System**: Fixed guest mode errors in achievement initialization
- **Database Testing**: Created comprehensive schema testing utilities

### ✅ Multi-Storage Integration
- **Unified Data Loading**: Integrated Supabase + IndexedDB + localStorage data sources
- **Statistics Fix**: Updated stats page to load from all storage systems
- **Home Page**: Replaced hardcoded stats with real-time data calculations
- **Query Optimizer**: Enhanced to support guest mode with IndexedDB fallback

### ✅ User Experience Improvements
- **Auto-Save Working**: Both guest and authenticated modes now save properly
- **Statistics Display**: All pages show actual user data instead of placeholder values
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents achievement errors from blocking saves
- **Data Consistency**: Implemented deduplication logic across storage systems

### ✅ Code Quality & Architecture
- **Guest/Auth Flow**: Proper separation of guest and authenticated user workflows
