# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new project directory with no existing codebase. The project is named "CupNote" based on the directory name.

## Getting Started

Since this is an empty project, future instances of Claude Code should:

1. Ask the user about the intended technology stack and project type
2. Help set up the appropriate project structure based on the user's requirements
3. Initialize version control if needed
4. Create necessary configuration files based on the chosen technology

## Notes

- No existing build, test, or lint commands are available yet
- No architecture or code structure exists to document
- Project requirements and technology choices need to be determined
