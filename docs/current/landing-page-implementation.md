## 📊 Implementation Summary

### 🎯 What Was Implemented

Based on the marketing and design team review, we successfully implemented viewport-specific hero landing page optimizations:

## 📱 Viewport-Specific Messages

### Desktop (1024px+)
**Before:**
- "당신의 커피 이야기를 기록하고 성장하세요"
- Generic and abstract

**After:**
- "매일 마시는 커피, 특별한 이야기가 되다"
- Emotional appeal with concrete daily context
- Subtitle: "2분 기록, 30초 분석, 평생 남는 나만의 커피 데이터베이스"

### Tablet (768px - 1023px) 
**Before:**
- Same as desktop (not optimized)

**After:**
- "오늘 마신 커피, 잊지 않고 기록하세요"
- Action-oriented with immediate relevance
- Subtitle: "단 2분! 나만의 커피 취향을 발견하는 가장 쉬운 방법"

### Mobile (<768px)
**Before:**
- Same as desktop (too long for mobile)

**After:**
- "커피 일기, 2분이면 충분해요"
- Ultra-concise with time benefit
- Subtitle: "1,247명이 선택한 가장 쉬운 커피 기록 앱"

## 🚀 Key Improvements
